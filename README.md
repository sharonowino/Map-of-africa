This interactive African Map is visualized using Folium (a Python library for interactive maps) with the ArcGIS Geocoder API to visualize town locations across West and Central Africa—specifically Ghana, Cameroon, Mali, and Côte d'Ivoire. The map provides an engaging, user-friendly interface for exploring urban centers in these countries with accurate geocoding and dynamic markers.
Some advantages of this mapping approach include the high-accuracy coordinates provided by ArcGIS, even for remote towns, and the ability to embed the map in Jupyter notebooks using Folium. With minimal code required for dynamic geocoding and rendering, this method democratizes spatial analysis, making it accessible to researchers and developers working in African regions.
