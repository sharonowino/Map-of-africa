This interactive African Map visualizes using Folium and ArcGIS Geocoder. Folium (a Python library for interactive maps) with the ArcGIS Geocoder API to visualize town locations across West and Central Africa—specifically Ghana, Cameroon, Mali, and Côte d'Ivoire. The map provides an engaging, user-friendly interface for exploring urban centers in these countries with accurate geocoding and dynamic markers.
ArcGIS ensures high-accuracy coordinates even for remote towns, while Folium allows embedding of the map in Jupyter notebooks. Minimal code handles geocoding and rendering dynamically, thus this approach democratizes spatial analysis making it accessible for researchers and developers working in African regions.
